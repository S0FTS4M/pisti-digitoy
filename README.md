# Unity Pishti Game 
Clone the repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/S0FTS4M/pisti-digitoy.git
```
Then initialize submodule. I added UI-Extensions as a submodule.
```bash
git submodule init
```

Update the submodule.
```bash
git submodule update
```

Open Unity then goto Scenes folder. Open Main scene. You are ready to go.

## NOTES
- A warning can be shown when they do not have enough money to enter the room
- A warning can be shown when he leaves the game halfway through that he will lose the money
- When newgame is called in Table Options, a warning can be shown if the money is not enough
